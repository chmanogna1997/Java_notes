******* static keyword ************

==> Static keyword can be for variable, method , class

==> In Java Static keyword is mainly used for memmory management.

==> Static variable::

    Understanding the problem without static:
    ==> class Student{
	                 int rollno;
					 String name;
					 String college = "IBO";
	                 }
   ==> If there are 10000 students in a school. When each instance is created memory gets allacated.
       All students are unique hence fields rollno, name will be unique. But college is common for all instances.
       and memory allocation for this everytime is a waste. we use static key word in this instance for 
       memory utilization.

==> Static Method:
    
	 ==> Static method belongs to the class instaed of the object.
	 ==> **** static method in the class can be called even before initializing the object.
	      Example ::
		  class student{
		  public static void display(){ System.out.println("IM in static method display of student class")}
		  }
	      
		  public static void main(){
		     Student.display(); // will print the statement:: need not initialize the student object
		  }

	  ==> Static method can access/change only static varables. can only call other static methods. non-static methods cannot
	       be called from these methods.

==> Why Java main method is static?
    ==> It is because object is not required to call the static method. and resolves the problem of memory allocation.
	

************************  FINAL KEY WORD ****************

==> similar to constant
    ==> cannot be changed ===> for a final variables
	==> cannot be inherited/extend ===> for a final class
	==> cannot be overriden ===> for a final method
	
==> final variable can be static, protected , private or public.

==> ** If there is a blank final variable declared but not initialized. Then it can be only 
    initialized in constructor .
	==> class Student{
	     final String college_name;
		
		Student(String college){
		   college_name = college;
		}
	}

===> ** Similarly as above if the variable that is static, final has been declared but not initialized.
     can be declared only in statc methods.
	 ==> class Student{
	     final static String college_name;
		
		       static give_value(){
		        college_name = "IBO";
		   }
	    }
