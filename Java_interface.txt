 ******* Interface **********
 
 ==> Interface is a reference type is java. It specifies the behaviour of the class like what to do not how to do.
 ==> It is a  collection of only abstarct methods( only method signature ,no body).
 ==> class implements interface.
 ==> How an interface different from a class.
      ==> you cannot initiate interface.
	  ==> interface does not contain any interface.
	  ==> all methods are abstract.
	  ==> An interface cannot contain instance fields. The only fiels that can appear are
	       either declared both static and final.
	 ==> An interface is not extended by a class( that means we canot inherit interface classes), it is implemented.
	 ==> An interface can extend multiple interface classes.
	 
==> interface keyword is used declare an interface class.
==> methods in interface class are implicity abstract and public. Hence you need not give any keyword abstract for the method. 
==> class that implements the interface should define all the abstract mehods defined in interface class.
                                                (OR) we can simply say that
	If a class implements an interface, it is implicity agree to implement all methods/behaviours of interface class.

==> Used to acieve multiple inheritance which cannot be done using extend keyword.

==> public interface class_name{
        // Any no of static/ final fields
		// Any no of abstract methods.
       }
	   
==> Rules overridding methods defined in interfaces::
     => signature and return type should be maintained same.
	 ==> an interface class can implement  otherinterface class.==> 	 
==> if a class implementing an interface class need follow few rules:
    ==> A class can implement more than 1 interface class.
    ==> A class can extend only one class but A class can implement more than 1 interfaces classes.
