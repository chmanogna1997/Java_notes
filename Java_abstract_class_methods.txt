*************  Java abstraction ***************

==> In oops the abstraction is the process of hididng implementation details from user. In other words the user knows what that does
    instead how it does.
	
==> In java abstarction is achieved using Abstract classes and interfaces.
==> abstract keyword is used while declaring abstract classes.
==> If the class has 1 abstract method it should be declared abstract.
==> abstract classes cannot be instantiated like interface classes.
==> Just like interface if you inherit abstract class, you have to provide the implementation of all the methods.


==> Abstarct method ==> doesnt have any logic.
==> public abstract void play()

==> Declaring a method abstarct has 2 consequences
    ==> class containing the method must be abstarct.
	==> Any class inheriting this class having abstract method must implement the method in it.
	
==>    Both Abstarct class and interface class are meant for abstraction. Lets see the difference.


        ==> Type of methods:
		    ==> Interface can have onlt abstract methods.
			==> Abstact class can have both abstract and non abstract methods.
			
		==> Type of variables:
		    ==> Interface can have only final or static variables. variables declared are default considered as final 
			==> In Abstarct classs we can have => final, non-final, static, non-static variables.
			
		==> Implementation:
		    ==> Abstarct class can provide the implementation of interface class methods.
			==> Interface class cannot provide any implementation.
			
		==> Keywords to use the class :
		    ==> If a class wanna use interface class => implements keyword is used
			      class A implements class B
			==> If a class wanna use abstract class => extends keyword is used.
			      class A extends class B
				  
		==> Multiple implementations:
		     ==> An interface class can extend only an interface class.
			 ==> an abstarct class can extend another java class and implement multiple interface classes.
			 
		==> Acceesibility of data members :
		     ==> Memenbers in interface class are all/ always public.
			 ==> Members in abstract class maybe public, private, protected. etc
