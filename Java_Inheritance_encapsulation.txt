 ***** OOPS ***********
 
 object is a bundle of data nad logic(code)
 
 class is a blueprint of an object
 
 class attributes also called as fields, object attributes,instance variables, properties.
 
 class methods also called as functions
 
 
 *********************** ENCAPSULATION ***********************************
 
 ==> Encapsulation is hiding data/code or  wrapping up the data/code  ==> simply data hiding.
 ==>  means variables/code of class are hidden to other classes.
 ==> To acheve encapsulation in JAVA
     => declare variables in private and provide public getter and setter methods.
==> Benefits of Encapsulation ==> class has total over what is being stored in its fields


*************** INHERITANCE ***********************************

==> One class(child) acquires the propeties of the other class(parent). ==> In simple child class can access
    properties and methods of the parent class but there are few cases where child cannot inherit/access parent class
	lets discuss below/ further.
==> child class is also called as derived class,subclass
==> parent class is also called as base class , superclass
==> ** EXTENDS ** is the keyword used to inherit.
==> **** NOTE : Constructors are not members of the class hence these cannot be inherited.
    but constructor of parent class can be invoked by the child class.
	  
==> ****** Following below code will not compile

       class Horse {
                    private int age;
                    Horse(int age) {
                                    this.age = age;
                                   }
                    }

       class Pony extends Horse {
        private int age;
        Pony(int age) { //here compiler complains about no default constructor in parent class
                     this.age = age;
                       }
                   }  
				   
	   ==> Why ??? => the sub class constructor must invoke the super class constructor. If we dont the compiler
	        will call the no-args constructor of super class for you. Here there is no arg constructor hence we are getting the error
       ==> How to fix this give 
	   
	        class pony extends Horse{ 
			                    Pony(int age){
								              super(age);
								             }
								}

==> The Super Key word::
   ==> super key word is like this key word . Where it is used??
       ==> if we have variables  or methods with similar name => we use super keyword.
	   ==> used to invoke super class/parent class constructor.
	   
==> Inheitance , extents key word gives a IS-A relation.
     ==> Example:
	   class Animal{}
	   class mammal extends Animal(){}  ==> mammal IS-A animal
	   class reptile extends Animal(){}  ==> reptile IS-A animal
	   class Dog extends Mammal(){}    ==> Dog IS-A animal and also DOG IS-A mammal
==> Instance keyword ==> gives true if IS-A relationship is satisfied.
    ==> Example(from above)
        Animal A = new Animal();
        Mammal M = new Mammal();
		Dog D = new Dog();
       
        System.out.println( M instance Animal)  => true	   
		System.out.println( D instance Animal)  => true	   
	   
==>  Types of inheritance
     ==> Single Inheritance :: A -> B
	 ==> Muli level Inheritance :: A -> B -> C
	 ==> Hierarchical Inhertance ::     A-> B ; A-> C ( parent having more children)
	 ==> Multiple Inhertance :: A -> B; C -> B ( children(B) having more than one parent(A,C) *** this is not supported in JAVA ****
	 
	 ==> In subclass we can over ride the methods of super class
