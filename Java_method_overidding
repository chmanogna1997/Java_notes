***************  JAVA method overriding ************

==> the subclass can override the method present in its parent class.
==> overiding means not extending the logic but completley changing the logic of the method.
==> You cannot override a method that is declared final.
==> we can have multilevel overriding.
==> Lets see an interesting example::
      
	   class Animal {
	      public void move(){ System.out.println("Animal can move");}
	    }
		
		class Dog extends Animal(){
		@override
		public void move(){System.out.println(" Dog can move");}
		
		public void bark() {System.out.println("Dog can bark")}
		}
		
		public ststic void main(){
		Animal A = new Animal();
		Animal D = new Dog(); ///  check here 
		
		A.move() // OUTPUT :: Animal can move.
		
		D.move() // OUTPUT: DOG can move.
		
		D.bark() // ***** this gives compilation error as D is animal reference type and doesnot have bark() method in it.
		                  and this is called polymorphism.
		}
		
==> Rules for overriding:
    ==> If the method is not inherited we cannot ovverride it.
	==> ***** we cannot ovver ride static , final , private blocks and constructors.
	==> If method is declared public in superclass, it cannot be declared private or protected in subclass
	     private > protected > public.
	==> If method is protected in superclass => it can be declared public/protected but not private.
	==> Overriding method should have the same return type.
	==> abstract methods in abstract class and interface class are meant to be overriden.
