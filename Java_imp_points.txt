***** imp points ***********

==> You cannot have 2 public classes within the same java file ==> it throws error
     Example: 
	 
	 public class shape{} // this throws error as we cannot have 2 public classes in same file.
	 public class main{
	  public static void main() {
	    .....
	  }
	 }
	 
	 


==> static vs global variable
 static keyword => we can add access keywords like private and public . variable with static and public is similar to global variable
==> use of static keyword
  Static keyword ==> mainly used for memory management 
==> Static method restrictions
in static method we can only access static variables and static methods directly. we cannot refer this, .super 
==>call nested classes
outer_class{
  inner_class{
    ......
  }
}
the initate inner class we need to initiate outer class
class_six.six_Sub C6_sub = C6.new six_Sub();

outer_class.inner_class I = new O.new inner_class

==> to access private class

  Method M = class_four.class.getDeclaredMethod("display_class",null);

        M.setAccessible(true);
        M.invoke(C4);
		
 libraries used ==> 
import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
